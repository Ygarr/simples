This project is an extremely simple http server.  It was written to
transfer files between computers when a USB stick isn't handy, or is
prohibited by IT security policies (ahem).  It's designed to be launched
on the command line, and shut down when the file transfer is finished.
</p><p>
It implements both file upload and download, and it works with very large
files -- files over 100 GB have been transferred with it, in both directions.
It's written in Kotlin, and should run against any Java runtime.
